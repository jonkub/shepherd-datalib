- add timezone to datetime-objects
- more explicit typing

## v2023.9.9

- lots of bugfix
- validate data vs data_type on firmware
- offer example for generic experiment definitions
- shepherd_data: also export stdout-log


## v2023.9.8

- new example and generators
- lots of small bugfixes

## v2023.9.7

- refine content-paths and path-handling of the testbed
- rework data-generators in '/extra'
- testbed-client - add ownership-data if none was provided
- observer-task now has optional start-time and the other models can react to that
- update content-fixtures
- file-based content now has a local-flag to show it has to be copied to the testbed
- discard older fixture-buffer (1 day)

## v2023.9.6

- fix workflows
- latest pydantic-update 2.4 brings some speed improvement for sheep (<10%)

## v2023.9.4

- update fixtures with real testbed-data
- refine testbed-models
  - objects with active=False can't be used in experiment
  - target.id is now used as selector and is also encouraged to be dynamic to shape the testbed (see layout-map in doc)
- integrate gpio-decoder into reader
  - .gpio_to_waveforms()
  - .gpio_to_uart()
- rework GitHub workflow to all release and publish by tagging a commit

## v2023.9.3

- uart-decoder: baudrate-detection more robust
- shpModel: change export to make sure set-parameters get exported
- generators: enable rec of uart
- refactor verbosity-system
- GitHubWorkflow refactoring
- add waveform-extraction for shepherd-data - cmd: extract-uart

## v2023.9.2

- breaking change: cores BaseReader and BaseWriter just become Reader & Writer

## v2023.09.0

- allow negative values when converting raw to SI-units
- lift restriction for pandas < v2
- update dependencies and fix incompats & warnings
- warn when files are not overwritten
- create data-generators for the testbed (./extra)
- improve file-handling
- bugfixes for task-handling
- update documentation
- update IPv4-representation
- extend model with more representation-types (yaml, str, dict, ...)

## v2023.08.8

- further fixes for datetimes
- make shpModel even more like a dict
- fix name-collisions
- add CapeData from Sheep
- extend User.active
- add output_paths to task-sets and make them compatible with prepare_tasks() & extract_tasks()

## v2023.08.7

- move to pydantic V2 with `bump-pydantic`
  - disadvantage 1: min-string-size for models had to be reduced from 4 to 1, due to different local overwriting-rules
  - disadvantage 2: its 60% slower on BBone

```Shell
sudo python3 -X importtime -c 'from shepherd_core.data_models.task import EmulationTask' 2> importtime.log
#  8.4 s on v2023.8.6, pydantic 1.10
# 13.9 s on v2023.8.7, pydantic 2.2.1, core 2.6.1
# 13.7 s with defer_build=True â‡¾ triggers bug?
```

## v2023.08.6

- add zstd-compression for embedded fw
- derive fw-name if not provided
- only mock uninstalled modules / packages
- speedup on BBone from 47 s to ~10 s
  - hash-default-value in user-model took 25 s
  - loading fixtures took 6 s (now pickled on first use)
  - scipy.stats takes 4.4 s to import in cal_measurement
  - requests takes 1.3 s to import in testbed_client
  - next slowest external module are: numpy 1.5 s, pwnlib.elf 1.4 s

## v2023.08.5
